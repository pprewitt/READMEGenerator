## Installation 
 You will need Node.js installed on your computer to run this application as it is built for the command line. Once Node is installed, you can fork or clone this repository, then open it via your integrated terminal. "node index.js" will initialize the application, then you will just need to answer the prompts as appropriate for your project. 
  
 
## Usage 
 This application was developed as a class project to explore and learn node and asyncronous JS. The application is a simple interface for creating markdown for your README files.
  
 
## Credits 
 I repurposed some class exercises on asyncronous functions to make this. No tutorials this time!
